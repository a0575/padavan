technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in

It also applies even if we knew or should have known about the possibility
of the damages. 

This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights
under the laws of your country. You may also have rights with respect to the
party from whom you acquired the software. This agreement does not change
