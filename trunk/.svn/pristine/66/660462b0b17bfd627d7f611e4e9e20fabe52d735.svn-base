 * This structure is per expected connection.  It is a member of struct

 * there and we are expected to only store the length of the data which
 * needs replaced.  If a packet contains multiple RTSP messages, we create
 * one expected connection per message.
 *
 * We use these variables to mark the entire header block.  This may seem
 * like overkill, but the nature of RTSP requires it.  A header may appear
 * multiple times in a message.  We must treat two Transport headers the
 * same as one Transport header with two entries.
